# Inventory Management Enhancement Implementation

## âœ… **Completed Features**

### **1. Database Tables Enhancement**
- **Waste Tracking Table**: `ingredient_waste` - Tracks ingredient waste with reasons
- **Reorder Notifications Table**: `reorder_notifications` - Manages automated reorder alerts

### **2. Automated Reorder Triggers**
- **System**: `automated_reorder_system.php`
- **Features**:
  - Monitors stock levels against reorder thresholds
  - Automatically generates reorder notifications
  - Calculates suggested reorder quantities
  - Prevents duplicate notifications

### **3. Waste Tracking System**
- **System**: `waste_tracking_system.php`
- **Features**:
  - Record ingredient waste with reasons (expired, damaged, production waste, spillage, other)
  - Track waste quantities and dates
  - Generate waste summaries by ingredient and reason
  - Historical waste analysis

### **4. Enhanced Stock Management**
- **Existing Features**: The stock table already had `reorder_level` and `supplier_name` fields
- **Integration**: Works with existing BOM system for ingredient consumption

## ðŸ”§ **How It Works**

### **Automated Reorder Process**
1. **Monitor**: System checks stock levels against reorder thresholds
2. **Trigger**: When stock â‰¤ reorder level, creates notification
3. **Calculate**: Suggests reorder quantity (3x reorder level)
4. **Notify**: Generates system notifications for staff

### **Waste Tracking Process**
1. **Record**: Staff records waste with reason and quantity
2. **Track**: System stores waste data with timestamps
3. **Analyze**: Generate reports by ingredient and reason
4. **Optimize**: Use data to reduce waste in future

## ðŸ“Š **Database Structure**

### **ingredient_waste Table**
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- ingredient_name (Ingredient that was wasted)
- waste_quantity (Amount wasted)
- waste_reason (expired, damaged, production_waste, spillage, other)
- waste_date (When waste occurred)
- recorded_by (User who recorded waste)
- notes (Additional notes)
- created_at (Timestamp)
```

### **reorder_notifications Table**
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- ingredient_name (Ingredient needing reorder)
- current_quantity (Current stock level)
- reorder_level (Threshold for reordering)
- suggested_quantity (Recommended order amount)
- notification_date (When notification was created)
- status (pending, acknowledged, ordered, received)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Usage Instructions**

### **Setting Up Reorder Levels**
1. Go to **Manage Stock** page
2. Set `reorder_level` for each ingredient
3. System will automatically monitor these levels

### **Running Reorder Checks**
1. Visit: `automated_reorder_system.php?run_check=1`
2. System will check all ingredients
3. Creates notifications for low stock items

### **Recording Waste**
1. Visit: `waste_tracking_system.php`
2. Fill in waste details (ingredient, quantity, reason, date)
3. Submit to record waste

### **Viewing Dashboard**
1. Visit: `inventory_dashboard.php`
2. See stock levels, reorder notifications, and waste summary

## ðŸš€ **Benefits**

### **For Business**
- **Prevent Stockouts**: Automated alerts prevent running out of ingredients
- **Reduce Waste**: Track and analyze waste to optimize usage
- **Cost Control**: Better inventory management reduces costs
- **Efficiency**: Automated processes save time

### **For Operations**
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Always know what needs reordering
- **Waste Analysis**: Understand waste patterns and reduce losses
- **Proactive Management**: Address issues before they become problems
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Use analytics to optimize inventory

## ðŸ”— **Integration Points**

### **With Existing Systems**
- **BOM System**: Works with existing ingredient consumption tracking
- **POS System**: Integrates with sales and inventory reduction
- **Notifications**: Uses existing notification system
- **Stock Management**: Enhances existing stock management

### **Future Enhancements**
- **Email Alerts**: Send reorder notifications via email
- **Supplier Integration**: Direct ordering with suppliers
- **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed waste and usage analysis
- **Mobile App**: Mobile access to inventory dashboard
