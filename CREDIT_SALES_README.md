#### Files Modified:
- `save_order.php` - Enhanced to handle credit sales and debtor management
- `pos.php` - Updated credit sale modal with customer information display
- `debtors.php` - Now shows real debtor data from database

### 2. Sales List CRUD Operations

#### New Functionality:
- **Delete Sales** - Completely remove sales records with proper cleanup
- **Download PDF/HTML Invoice** - Generate downloadable invoices for sales
- **Real-time Updates** - Table refreshes after operations

#### Files Created:

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Install Database Tables
1. Navigate to your project directory
2. Open `install_debtors_tables.php` in your browser
3. This will automatically create the required database tables

### Step 2: Test the Features
1. **Credit Sales**: Go to POS page, add products, select a customer, and choose "Credit Sale"
2. **View Debtors**: Check the debtors page to see credit customers
3. **Sales CRUD**: Go to sales list and test delete/download functionality

## How Credit Sales Work

### Process Flow:
1. Customer selects products in POS
2. Customer chooses "Credit Sale" payment method
3. System shows customer information in confirmation modal
4. Upon confirmation:
   - Order is saved with `payment_status = 'pending'`
   - Customer is added to `debtors` table (if not already there)
   - Debt transaction is recorded
   - Total debt is updated

### Debtor Management:
- Debtors are automatically created when credit sales are made
- Debt amounts are tracked and updated
- If a debtor pays off all debt, they're removed from the debtors table
- All debt transactions are logged for audit purposes

## How Sales CRUD Works

### Delete Functionality:
- Confirms deletion with user
- Removes order items first (foreign key constraint)
- Removes the order record
- For credit sales: updates debtor records and debt amounts
- Refreshes the page to show updated data

### Download Functionality:
- Generates professional HTML invoice
- Includes company information, customer details, and itemized list
- Downloads as HTML file (can be printed or converted to PDF)
- Shows special note for credit sales
