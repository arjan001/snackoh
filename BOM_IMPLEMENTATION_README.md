# Bill of Materials (BOM) Implementation - Snackoh Bakery

## Overview
This implementation provides a realistic **Bill of Materials (BOM)** flow for the Snackoh Bakery Management System. When products are sold, the system automatically consumes ingredients from stock based on the product's recipe, ensuring accurate inventory tracking.

## 🎯 **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Realistic BOM Flow**
```
Recipe Creation → Ingredient Assignment → Product Creation → Sales → Inventory Reduction
```

### **2. Inventory Validation**
- ✅ **Pre-sale validation**: Checks if products and ingredients are available
- ✅ **Real-time stock checking**: Validates quantities before processing
- ✅ **Error prevention**: Prevents sales when inventory is insufficient

### **3. Automatic Inventory Reduction**
- ✅ **Product stock reduction**: Decreases product quantities when sold
- ✅ **Ingredient consumption**: Automatically consumes ingredients based on recipe
- ✅ **BOM-based tracking**: Links products to their required ingredients

### **4. Ingredient Usage Tracking**
- ✅ **Consumption logging**: Records every ingredient consumed
- ✅ **Transaction linking**: Links usage to specific orders
- ✅ **Historical tracking**: Maintains complete usage history

## 📋 **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Install Required Tables**
1. Run `install_ingredient_usage_table.php` in your browser
2. This creates the `ingredient_usage` table for tracking

### **Step 2: Create Recipes with Ingredients**
1. Go to **Recipes** page
2. Create a recipe (e.g., "Bread Recipe")
3. Add ingredients with quantities (e.g., Flour: 500g, Yeast: 10g, Water: 300ml)
4. Save the recipe

### **Step 3: Create Products with Recipes**
1. Go to **Create Product** page
2. Create a product (e.g., "White Bread")
3. **Select the recipe** you created
4. Set product quantity, price, etc.
5. Save the product

### **Step 4: Add Ingredients to Stock**
1. Go to **Manage Stock** page
2. Add ingredients (e.g., Flour, Yeast, Water)
3. Set quantities and units
4. These ingredients will be consumed when products are sold

### **Step 5: Test the BOM Flow**
1. Go to **POS** page
2. Add products to cart
3. Complete the sale
4. Check that:
   - Product stock decreased
   - Ingredients were consumed
   - Usage was logged

## 🔄 **How the BOM Flow Works**

### **When a Product is Sold:**

1. **Pre-Sale Validation**
   ```
   Check Product Stock → Check Recipe Ingredients → Validate Quantities
   ```

2. **If Validation Passes**
   ```
   Process Sale → Reduce Product Stock → Consume Ingredients → Log Usage
   ```

3. **If Validation Fails**
   ```
   Show Error → Prevent Sale → List Missing Items
   ```

### **Example: Bread Sale**
```
Product: White Bread (Qty: 2)
Recipe: Bread Recipe
Ingredients: Flour (500g), Yeast (10g), Water (300ml)

Result:
- Product Stock: -2 breads
- Flour Consumed: -1000g (500g × 2)
- Yeast Consumed: -20g (10g × 2)
- Water Consumed: -600ml (300ml × 2)
```

## 📊 **Database Tables**

### **ingredient_usage Table**
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- product_name (Product sold)
- ingredient_name (Ingredient consumed)
- quantity_consumed (Amount used)
- order_id (Links to order)
- transaction_id (Links to transaction)
- usage_date (When consumed)
```

### **Key Relationships**
- **products** ↔ **recipes** (via recipe_name)
- **recipes** ↔ **recipe_ingredients** (via recipe_id)
- **ingredient_usage** ↔ **orders** (via order_id)

## 🛡️ **Error Handling**

### **Insufficient Stock Errors**
```
"Cannot process order due to insufficient inventory:

Insufficient Product Stock:
White Bread (Available: 5, Needed: 10)

Insufficient Ingredients:
Flour (Available: 2000g, Needed: 5000g)
Yeast (Available: 50g, Needed: 100g)"
```

### **Validation Checks**
- ✅ Product exists in database
- ✅ Product has sufficient stock
- ✅ Product has associated recipe
- ✅ Recipe has ingredients
- ✅ Ingredients exist in stock
- ✅ Ingredients have sufficient quantities
